IoT based Smart Parking System 

One of the key issues that smart cities relate to are car parking facilities and traffic management systems. In present day cities finding an available parking spot is always difficult for drivers, and it tends to become harder with ever increasing number of private car users. This situation can be seen as an opportunity for smart cities to undertake actions in order enhance the efficiency their parking resources thus leading to reduction in searching times, traffic congestion and road accidents. Problems pertaining to parking and traffic congestion can be solved if the drivers can be informed in advance about the availability of parking spaces at and around their intended destination. With this system, drivers can easily see parking spaces with their mobile devices before they go to parking lots of their choice. Furthermore, in this project, the gate status is also shown.

In this project:

  * Arduino Wemos D1, Ultrasonic sensor and Servo motor
  * Node-red as the main server
  * MQTT and HTTP protocols
  * Mysql Database
  * Graphical interface (WebPage) using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP
  * **Long Polling method in WebPage** (Long polling is a method that server applications use to hold a client connection until information becomes available)

used.
